# Introduction

---

Starter code examples for various microcontrollers that works with the existing serial blocks

# Prerequisites

---

1. basic knowledge of microcontrollers.
2. A microcontroller of your own for example an Arduino UNO or an Esp32.

if you donâ€™t have a microcontroller you can use a [virtual serial port](https://www.virtual-serial-port.org/).

# Contribution

---

### you may contribute by

- Adding more features to an existing microcontroller code example.
- Coding the same features for the same microcontroller but in native language i.e without code generators.
- Adding support for more microcontrollers like PIC.
- Donating parts to other developers.
